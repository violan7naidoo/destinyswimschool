							<h3>History</h3>
							<p>In 2009, a group of passionate swimming enthusiasts came together to create a swim school that would offer top-quality swimming instruction to people of all ages and skill levels. Over the years, this swim school has become a leading provider of swimming lessons in KwaZulu-Natal and has developed a reputation for excellence.</p> 
							<p>From the very beginning, the founders of the swim school knew that they wanted to offer a program that was not only fun and engaging, but also safe and effective. To this end, they partnered with various government organizations to ensure that their program met the highest safety standards. They also hired only certified training instructors who were experienced and knowledgeable about the latest swimming techniques and best practices.</p>

						<div class="desc">
							<h3>Mission &amp; Vission</h3>
							<p>As the years went by, the swim school's reputation grew, and more and more people began to enroll in its programs. The school's instructors became known for their patient and encouraging teaching style, and many students found that they were able to learn to swim much faster than they had expected.</p> 
							<p>One of the reasons that the swim school has been so successful is that it offers a range of different programs to meet the needs of different students. For beginners, there are basic swim classes that focus on water safety and basic swimming skills. For more advanced swimmers, there are classes that focus on stroke development and competitive swimming techniques. The school also offers private lessons for students who prefer one-on-one instruction.</p>
							<p>Over the years, the swim school has also developed a strong sense of community. Many students have become close friends with their classmates and instructors, and the school often hosts events and activities that bring everyone together. This sense of community has helped to create a positive and supportive learning environment, which has in turn helped many students to achieve their swimming goals.</p>
							<p>Looking to the future, the swim school is committed to continuing to provide the highest quality swimming instruction to students of all ages and backgrounds. With its experienced instructors, commitment to safety, and strong sense of community, the school is poised to remain a leading provider of swimming lessons in KwaZulu-Natal for many years to come.</p>
